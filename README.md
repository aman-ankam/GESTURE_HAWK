Main source file is mask.py. It consists of main source code that runs the given code. This code has some chunks of Pyserial interface functions due to which it will display error if you have not connected any serial device to it. Please make sure you connect a serial device to your system before running the script or add lines of codes related to serial communication in comments. 
extreme.py consists of source code of detection of hand gesture on still images. Users can get better idea of working of algorithm from this piece of code.
